\section{Time calibration}

In this part a suitable calibration to transform the channel axis to a time axis is determined. In order to collect appropriate measurements for that, the moveable detector is fixed at the minimal distance from the source, an the discriminator threshold is set to a value of 55, so that most $\SI{511}{keV}$ quanta are detected, but any noise is cut off. The manual delay of the TPC is set to $\Delta t = \SI{2}{ns}$ which works as the zero value. Now, the spectrum is measured at multiple manual delay times, from $\Delta t = \SIrange[]{0}{32}{ns}$ with a distance of \SI{4}{ns} each. A measured spectrum is seen in

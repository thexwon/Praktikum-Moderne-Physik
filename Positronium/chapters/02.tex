\section{Measurement Principle}
As there is a low chance of a three-quantum decay occurring inside a molecular substance, we can conclude that the observed positron annihilation  emits radiation quanta of either a fixed \SI{0.511}{MeV} from the singlet state positrons, or a continuous spectrum with the same maximum energy from the pick-off processes.
In order to determine the lifetime of the positron, observing a $\beta^+$-decay of which one of the products emits a $\gamma$ quantum is necessary. The detection of such a gamma quantum marks the start of the positrons lifetime, and also the time of possible formation for positronium, after a deceleration time of roughly   
\SI{e-12}{s}. In this experiment, $^{22}$Na is used
as the source of $\beta^+$-particles. During the decay, the  daughter nucleus is $^22$Ne preferentially left in an excited state. The transition to the ground state has an average lifetime of \SI{e-13}{s} and releases a $\gamma$-quantum with the energy of \SI{1.276}{MeV}. As the average lifetime of the transition is below the measurement accuracy, it is taken as instantaneous.

The task of this experiment is to measure the average lifetime of positronium in plexiglas. $^{22}$Na is used as the source for $\beta ^{+}$-particles. It decays into $^{22}$Ne emitting a $\gamma$-quantum, which is detected and marks the start signal for the TPC (time to pulseheight converter). Another detector registers the entire energy spectrum. The $\gamma$-quanta are detected by plastic scintillators arranged in a way that the start and stop quanta fly apart at an angle of $180$Â°. It should be mentioned that the start quanta should arrive $1\,$ns before the stop quanta. Therefore, the stop quanta will have a delay of about $2$\,ns in every measurement.
